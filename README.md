## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used the following CSS Grid layout for my desktop layout solution.

```css
@media (min-width: 60em) {
	main {
		width: auto;
		height: 800px;
		grid-template-columns: minmax(450px, 610px) minmax(300px, 610px);
		grid-template-rows: 100px 700px;
		grid-template-areas:
			'logo girl'
			'content girl';
		background: url('./assets/bg-pattern-desktop.svg') no-repeat;
	}
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- React
- Svelte
- Nextjs
- Vue
- Semantic HTML
- CSS

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax) - This is a great resource that I used to fix an issue with the desktop layout.
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-styling-form-input-validity) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand how to update inputs by their :invalid pseudo selector. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
